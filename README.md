CSSharp Panel - Admin Web Panel for CounterStrikeSharp
</h3>

CSSharp Panel is a web panel for CounterStrikeSharp that includes many features such as servers management, admins management, ban & comms management, rcon functions and much more, with a modern UI and a lot of customization options.

## Important Note

The current way of running the panel is harder for non developers, and the panel is not yet ready for production use, it's still in development and many features are missing, but it's a good start for a panel and it's already usable for some basic features, if you want to help with the development, feel free to join the discord and ask for help or contribute to the project.

I will change the way of running the panel to be easier for non developers in the future, and I will add more features and make the panel ready for production use.
